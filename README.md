This is a REST-for-Physics library used to generate solar axions and obtain the detection probability function. The library allows to define a generic helioscope setup - buffer gas, magnetic field, optics response, photon transmission - through REST metadata structures.

### Retrieving RestAxionLib with sub-modules

This library must be installed as a submodule at the main [REST-for-Physics Framework](https://github.com/rest-for-physics/framework/). Follow the README instructions to clone REST from that repository. Once you have a local copy, this module can be retrieved at the framework by executing.

```
python3 pull-submodules.py --lfna
```

Be aware that this is a private repository, and you may need to request access and add your public ssh key to your GutLab LFNA account.

### Prerequisites

As any REST library, RestAxionLib requires a running installion of REST-for-Physics Framework. But on top of that, some calculations require higher precision arithmetics and we need to use a external library named `mpfr`. 
We use a c++ wrapper that is available at the [following site](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/mpfr/#intro). This wrapper (mpreal.h) is already available/uploaded to this repository.

All you need to be able to compile RestAxionLib is to install the [mpfr](https://www.mpfr.org) and [mpir](http://mpir.org) libraries. Download the source, compile, and install. 
Usually as simple as running `./configure`, `make` and `make install` at the downloaded source directory.

#### mpfr and mpir installation:

Download the file `mpfr-4.0.2.tar.gz` from the following [site](https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/#download) compile and install executing the following commands.

```
wget https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr-4.1.0.tar.gz
tar -zxvf mpfr-4.1.0.tar.gz
cd mpfr-4.1.0/
./configure
make
sudo make install (to do a system installation)
```

In order to install mpir, download the file `mpir-3.0.0.tar.bz2` from the following [link](http://mpir.org/downloads.html) into the `~/mpir-3.0.0` directory

2) Executing the following commands should do the job:

```
wget http://mpir.org/mpir-3.0.0.tar.bz2
tar xvjf mpir-3.0.0.tar.bz2
cd mpir-3.0.0
./configure
make
sudo make install (to do a system installation)
```

### RestAxionLib installation

Once you have all the prerequisites installed you need to add the library at the REST-for-Physics framework compilation stage. Go to the main framework build directory and add the axion library as a compilation option.

```
cd framework/build
cmake -DRESTLIB_AXION=ON ../
make -j4 install
```
